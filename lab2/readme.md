I started by creating a div to hold everything in.
I used JavaScript/AJAX/jQuery to make the API call, parse the json, pick out specific data points.
I then used javascript again to scroll through humidity, pressure, high, and low, 2 at a time and in 5 second intervals.
I finally used CSS to format it to my liking.
